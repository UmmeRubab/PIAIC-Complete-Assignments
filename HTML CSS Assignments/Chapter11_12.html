            <li>Cloud Native Computing</li><br />
            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li><br />
            <li>Blockchain</li><br />
            <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>

        <h2>Cloud Native Computing:</h2>

        <p>The Cloud Native Computing program prepares the students to program in open source
        technologies like, Linux, Docker, Kubernetes, JavaScript, Node.js, React and React Native
        while introducing the students to development of Microservices and software development
        techniques on cloud platforms like AWS.</p>

        <h2>Artificial Intelligence:</h2>

        <p>The artificial intelligence program of PIAIC takes the student through the foundation of the AI
            technology, via teaching programming in open source languages like Python, Numpy, Pandas,
            Tensorflow 2.0 and Flask, and teaching deploying practical AI solutions and use cases, and
            ending with real-life examples of modern day AI in practice.</p>
